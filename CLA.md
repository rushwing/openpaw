# OpenPaw Individual Contributor License Agreement

**Version 1.0**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenPaw ("Project"), maintained by Daniel Wong
("Project Owner"). This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted
by contributors to the Project Owner.

By submitting a pull request or otherwise contributing to this repository, you accept the terms
of this Agreement.

---

## 1. Definitions

- **"You"** means the individual submitting a Contribution.
- **"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including modifications or additions
  to existing work, submitted to the Project.
- **"Submit"** means any form of communication sent to the Project Owner, including pull
  requests, issues, emails, or any electronic communication.

## 2. Copyright Grant

You grant the Project Owner a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable copyright license to:

- reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
  distribute your Contributions and such derivative works;
- license your Contributions under any license the Project Owner chooses, including licenses
  that differ from the license under which the Project is currently distributed (including
  proprietary and commercial licenses).

This grant enables the Project Owner to dual-license the Project — for example, distributing
the open-source version under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3) while also
offering the Project under a commercial license.

## 3. Patent Grant

You grant the Project Owner a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
transfer the Project, where such license applies only to patent claims licensable by you that
are necessarily infringed by your Contribution(s) alone or in combination with the Project.

## 4. Representations

You represent that:

1. You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses.
2. Each Contribution is your original creation, or you have sufficient rights to submit it.
3. Your Contribution does not, to the best of your knowledge, infringe any third-party
   intellectual property rights.
4. If your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either:
   (a) received permission from your employer to submit the Contribution, or
   (b) your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to this Project.
5. You will notify the Project Owner promptly if any of these representations become inaccurate.

---

## 5. No Obligation

You understand that the decision to include your Contribution in the Project rests solely with
the Project Owner, and this Agreement does not obligate the Project Owner to do so.

---

## 6. Governing Law

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the People's Republic of China, without regard to
its conflict-of-law provisions.

## How to Sign

You sign this Agreement by including the following line in every pull request description
(or in each commit message if you prefer):

```
I have read and agree to the OpenPaw CLA.
```

By including that statement you confirm that the representations in Section 4 are true for
the Contribution(s) in that pull request.
